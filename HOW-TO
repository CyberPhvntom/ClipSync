INSTALLATION

# 1) Clone the repository: 

# git clone https://github.com/CyberPhvntom/clipsync.git
# cd clipsync

# 2) Install dependencies:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIGURATION:

TARGET_WINDOW_TITLE = "Your Window Title Here"
time.sleep(1.5) # Change this value

# By default, ClipSync looks for a window titled "Claude". This is just a placeholder.
 You are free to use whatever AI you prefer. In fact, it does not have to be AI, at all!
 You can use ClipSync to automatically paste what you copy into a .doc file, notepad, etc!
 Simply change the Target Window Title to your desired window. 


The time.sleep parameter adjust the polling interval. ClipSync defaults to 1.5 seconds. 
This is how frequent (in seconds), the clipboard is monitored for content change.
A lower number results in a faster check, but is more resource-intensive. 



USAGE

# Open your favorite AI chat window. For example, Claude.
# Run the script: python clipsync.py
# Copy any text - it will automatically be sent to Claude.
